            <h3>James Baldwin</h3>
            <p>
              James Baldwin was an Author who was born on August 2nd, 1924 and grew up in the city of Harlem. Since he grew up in the early 1900s he faced a lot of racism. This is demonstrated in his writing. In fact, one of the most common themes in all of his writing is racism.

              <div class="col-md-6">
                <i class="bx bx-receipt"></i>
                <h4>Racism</h4>
                <p>Baldwin shows racism several times throughout his writing. A great example of this can be found in the book "The Fire Next Time". In this book, Baldwin says, "We cannot be free until they are free". By stating this in the book, Baldwin brings up a point that many people at the time did not want to talk about. That the white race and the black race are the same and that even though many white people knew this, they didn't want to talk about it as it would make them less "superior". Another example of this can be found in the essay "Notes of a native son". In this essay he describes how being an African American is being exactly like an unloved stepson. Although one(a black person) is no different then their siblings(a white person, the stepson is still looked upon as inferior.</p>

            <h3>Ta-nehisi Coates</h3>
            <p>
              Ta-nehisi Coates is an Author who was born on September 30, 1975. Similar to baldwin, Coates faced problems throughout his childhood. Coates' father had 7 children with 4 different women. Due to this, Coates grew up in povert. This can be shown through a major theme in his writing. Coates, often writes about poverty .

                <h4>The Black Body</h4>
                <p>Coates demonstrates the idea of the Black Body several times in his book "Between the World and Me". A good example of this is shown by the quote, "All our phrasing—race relations, racial chasm, racial justice, racial profiling, white privilege, even white supremacy––serves to obscure that racism is a visceral experience, that it dislodges brains, blocks airways, rips muscle, extracts organs, cracks bones, breaks teeth. You must never look away from this. You must always remember that the sociology, the history, the economics, the graphs, the charts, the regressions all land, with great violence, upon the body". Althoug Coates doesn't talk about the psychological effect of racism, his point still shows how the black body is percieved in America.</p>

          <h3>Common Themes</h3>
          <p>Both Baldwin and Coates experienced similar things in life. In fact, Coates was inspired by Baldwin to make the book "Between the world and Me". One of the most common themes throughout both of the author's writing is the general theme of struggle. For Baldwin, it was facing racism and for Coates it was living and growing up in poverty. </p>

                "Between the world and Me" is perhaps one of the most thoughtful and deep books I've ever read. Written by Ta-nehisi Coates, it demonstrates his ability to write about the being an African American in America. By including sensitive topics such as police brutality he really stands out as an author who writes his heart away.
