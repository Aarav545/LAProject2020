            <h3>James Baldwin</h3>
            <p>
              James Baldwin was an African American Author who was born on August 2nd, 1924. Since he grew up in the early 1900s he faced a lot of racism. This is demonstrated in his writing. In fact, one of the most common themes in all of his writing is racism.

                <h4>Racism</h4>
                <p>Baldwin shows racism several times throughout his writing. A great example of this can be found in the essay "Notes of a native son". In this essay he describes how being an African American is being exactly like an unloved stepson. Although one(a black person) is no different then their siblings(a white person, the stepson is still looked upon as inferior.</p>

              Baldwin’s early engagements with racial politics were similarly equivocal. He was sceptical about the Negritude movement of the 1950s, which sought to mobilise solidarity among the global African diaspora. Baldwin saw himself as a “bastard of the west”, shaped by his experience of western modernity; tethering himself to an imagined African identity would belie that reality.              <i class="bx bxs-quote-alt-right quote-icon-right"></i>

              It was one of those rare stories that didn’t just touch a nerve; it left a bruise. To a country that dared to pretend it had long ago cleared the books on 250 years of theft, Coates presented a discomfiting audit.              <i class="bx bxs-quote-alt-right quote-icon-right"></i>
